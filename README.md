# Xgression
## The Dynamic and Explainable Regression/Classification Solution
## Author : Thaphon Chinnakornsakul

Xgression is the solution to find relationships between data to an equation by constructing computational tree that represent the steps of calculation from inputs to an output of algorithm then modify the tree with various operator to find the optimal solution. As the result Xgression can perform many forms of regression without setting initial equations or parameters
